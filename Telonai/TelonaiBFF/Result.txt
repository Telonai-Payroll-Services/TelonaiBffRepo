Cut here and give this certificate to your employer.  Keep the top portion for your records.
PURPOSE - Complete Form NC-4, Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certificate, so that your employer can withhold the correct amount of 
State income tax from your pay.  If you do not provide an NC-4 to your 
employer, your employer is required to withhold based on single with 
zero allowances.FORM NC-4 EZ - You may use this form if you intend to claim either: exempt status, or the N.C. standard deduction and no tax credits or only 
the credit for children.  FORM NC-4 NRA - If you are a nonresident alien you must use Form NC-4 NRA.  FORM NC-4 BASIC INSTRUCTIONS - Complete the Allowance Worksheet.  The worksheet will help you figure the number of withholding 
allowances you are entitled to claim.  The worksheet is provided for 
employees to adjust their withholding allowances based on N.C. itemized 
deductions, federal adjustments to income, N.C. additions to federal 
adjusted gross income, N.C. deductions from federal adjusted gross 
income, and N.C. tax credits.  However, you may claim fewer allowances 
if you wish to increase the tax withheld during the year.  If your withholding 
allowances decrease, you must file a new NC-4 with your employer within 
10 days after the change occurs.  Exception:  When an individual ceases to 
be head of household after maintaining the household for the major portion 
of the year, a new NC-4 is not required until the next year.TWO OR MORE JOBS - If you have more than one job, figure the total number of allowances you are entitled to claim on all jobs using one Form 
NC-4 Allowance Worksheet.  Your withholding will usually be most accurate 
when all allowances are claimed on the NC-4 filed for the higher paying job 
and zero allowances are claimed for the other.  You should also refer to the 
Multiple Jobs Table to determine the additional amount to be withheld on 
line 2 of Form NC-4  (See Allowance Worksheet).NONWAGE INCOME - If you have a large amount of nonwage income, such as interest or dividends, you should consider making estimated tax 
payments using Form NC-40 to avoid underpayment of estimated tax 
interest.  Form NC-40 is available on our website at www.dornc.com under individual income tax forms.HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD -  Generally you may claim head of household status on your tax return only if you are unmarried and pay more than 
50% of the costs of keeping up a home for yourself and your dependent(s) 
or other qualifying individuals.  Note:  “Head of Household” for State tax 
purposes is the same as for federal tax purposes.SURVIVING SPOUSE - You may claim surviving spouse status only if your spouse died in either of the two preceding tax years and you meet the 
following requirements:1.
 
Your home is maintained as the main household of a child or stepchild for whom you can claim a federal exemption; and 2.
 
You were entitled to file a joint return with your spouse in the year of your spouse s death.MARRIED TAXPAYERS - For married taxpayers, both spouses must agree as to whether they will each complete the Allowance Worksheet based on 
married filing jointly or married filing separately. 
 
•
 
For married taxpayers completing the Allowance Worksheet based on married filing jointly, you will consider the sum of both spouses’ 
incomes, adjustments, additions, deductions, and credits on the 
Allowance Worksheet to determine the number of allowances. •
 
For married taxpayers completing the worksheet on the basis of married filing separately, each spouse will consider only his or her 
portion of income, adjustments, additions, deductions, and credits on 
the Allowance Worksheet to determine the number of allowances.  
All NC-4 forms are subject to review by the North Carolina Department 
of Revenue.  Your employer may be required to send this form to the 
North Carolina Department of Revenue.
CAUTION:  If you furnish an employer with an Employee’s Withholding Allowance Certificate that contains information which has no reasonable basis and results in a lesser amount of tax being withheld than would have been withheld had you furnished reasonable 
information, you are subject to a penalty of 50% of the amount not properly withheld.Web9-16
